✅ Implemented satellite data analysis for land use and deforestation tracking
✅ Created visualization tools for pollution impact
✅ Implemented haze feature extraction module

-   Created robust image preprocessing pipeline
-   Extracted key visual features (contrast, saturation, brightness)
-   Implemented transmission map estimation

Current tasks:

1. Enhance AQI estimation model

    - Improve CNN architecture for better accuracy
    - Add temporal data support
    - Implement cross-validation

2. Real-world testing

    - Collect test dataset
    - Validate accuracy against ground truth
    - Document performance metrics

3. Integration
    - Combine satellite and ground-level image analysis
    - Create unified API for all analysis tools
    - Implement real-time monitoring capabilities
