# SkyScanAI - TODO

## Completed Tasks:

-   Implemented satellite data analysis for land use and deforestation tracking.
-   Created visualization tools for pollution impact.
-   Implemented haze feature extraction module.
-   Created robust image preprocessing pipeline.
-   Extracted key visual features (contrast, saturation, brightness).
-   Implemented transmission map estimation.
-   Integrated YOLOv5 for pollution source detection.
-   Developed AQI estimation model using CNN and haze features.

## Current Tasks:

1.  Enhance AQI estimation model:

    -   Improve CNN architecture for better accuracy.
    -   Add temporal data support.
    -   Implement cross-validation.

2.  Real-world testing and validation:

    -   Collect diverse test datasets.
    -   Validate accuracy against ground truth data.
    -   Document performance metrics and limitations.

3.  System Integration:

    -   Combine satellite and ground-level image analysis.
    -   Create unified API for all analysis tools.
    -   Implement real-time monitoring capabilities.
    -   Develop a user-friendly interface for data input and result visualization.
